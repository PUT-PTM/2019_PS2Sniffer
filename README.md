# 2019_PS2Sniffer
# 1. Overview
  Our PSniffer project allows us to operate the keyboard with the PS/2 connector via stm32 microcontroller. 
  Almost every key pressed on keyboard causes display of characters on the HD44780
  display or other appropriate actions.

 # 3. Tools
 # 4. How to run
 # 5. How to compile
 # 6. Future improvements
 There are two small bugs : first problem is with fast writing which causes some letters might be missing 
 or duplicated and second problem is fast writing alternatively two characters which causes displaying only one character.
